# 卐卐卐 Nazi Detector 卐卐卐

This Chrome extension derives from the original code of the Coincidence Detector, the odious Chrome extension [used by white supremacists to identify Jews](https://mic.com/articles/145105/coincidence-detector-the-google-extension-white-supremacists-use-to-track-jews#.8erOlWuZ8). It, instead, identifies white supremacists on the Internet.

To check if you were targeted by the Coincidence Detector, see my other project, [The Grand Coincidence](http://progressivejews.org/echoes/).
