# 卐卐卐 Nazi Detector 卐卐卐

This Chrome extension derives from the original code of the (((Coincidence Detector))), the odious Chrome extension [used by white supremacists to identify Jews](https://mic.com/articles/145105/coincidence-detector-the-google-extension-white-supremacists-use-to-track-jews#.8erOlWuZ8) by placing a series of parentheses — known as echoes — around their names. This version, instead, identifies white supremacists by placing swastikas around 卐卐卐their names卐卐卐.

You can install this extension from [the Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nazi-detector/gepjahbfpbjebbdlpmagodedkiodklip).

To check if you were targeted by the (((Coincidence Detector))), see my other project, [The Grand Coincidence](http://progressivejews.org/echoes/).
